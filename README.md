## Senior Design Contract

### Project Summary

Our educational web app aims to teach foundational cooking skills, allowing users to confidently apply each learned skill to a variety of foods, beyond specific recipes. The web app will integrate high-quality video tutorials, secure and scalable data storage, and efficient backend services, providing a smooth, reliable, and enriching educational experience.

### Problem Statement

Research indicates that individuals who are confident in cooking meals at home tend to have better dietary outcomes (Utter, et al., 2018). However, many people feel intimidated by cooking. A study of 6,638 students (Wilson, et al., 2017) reported that 62.5% felt comfortable preparing meals from basic ingredients, 31% felt they could only use ready-made ingredients, and 6% had limited or no cooking ability.

Many online platforms suffer from issues like poor scalability, security concerns, and low-quality video streaming, making it difficult for users to access effective online learning, especially in areas with unreliable internet access.

### Solution

The Culinary Mastery app will address these challenges by offering:

- **High-Quality Video Tutorials**: Utilizing YouTube's API for smooth playback and accessibility.
- **Diverse & Accessible Content**: We will provide subtitles, closed captions, audio descriptions, high-contrast themes, alternative text for images, and multilingual support to cater to a wide audience.
- **Secure and Scalable Storage**: Azure DB will be used to securely store video files.
- **Scalable Backend Services**: Node.js will power backend services efficiently.

### Project Source

The project inspiration came from one team member’s sibling who struggled with online learning. The need for an easy-to-access educational tool became apparent, and each team member contributed ideas to build upon the concept.

### Project Objectives/Goals

The Culinary Mastery app aims to revolutionize cooking education by providing a comprehensive and flexible learning platform that empowers users with culinary knowledge, enhances creativity, and promotes continuous learning. It will offer structured, interactive learning experiences, personalized paths, and community forums.

### Team Members and Responsibilities

Security best practices will be followed per recommendations from OWASP, NIST, and CISA.

User-generated content will be moderated, and transparency will be maintained by citing sources and avoiding commercial biases. We will avoid using pop-up ads and affiliate links to maintain accessibility for all users.
